Qsoft

Qsoft is a collection of data analysis and modelling applications for use
in X-ray astronomy and related disciplines.

The modules available are:

qfits	to read and write FITS files
astro	astronomical/astrophysical applications
images	image display and manipulation
xscat	X-ray scattering and X-ray optical constant calculations
xsrt	sequential ray tracing code for the simulation of X-ray telescope optics

The applications are run as commands/functions within the scripting languages
R and/or Python.

The core code is written in Fortran and C which is compiled to produce
shareable object libraries. The commands/functions are defined in
R scripts or Python module scripts. The shareable objects are
loaded by R or accessed as modules by Python.

The Qsoft collection should be built using the gcc and gfortran compilers.
R and/or the Python module f2py must be available to create the
shareable objects.

Build and Installation
______________________

1) Unpack source code to some top directory /your/files/top/qsoft

2) Move into /your/files/top/qsoft and execute build
$ cd /your/files/top/qsoft
$ ./build

This will check you have gcc gfortran and R and/or Python with f2py.
It will then create the src/compiler.config file for make and
compile the shareable objects.

3) Put the following line into your /home/.profile

. /your/files/top/qsoft/setup_q

Qsoft will be available when you launch a login terminal.

4) That's it.

When you start R (or Rscript) it will automatically load the Qsoft applications
using the /home/.Rprofile file.

The environment variable PYTHONPATH will point to the qsoft/python_modules
directory so you can load the modules into Python.
