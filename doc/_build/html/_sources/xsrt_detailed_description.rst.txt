xsrt   - Detailed Description
*****************************

Each of the elements, including the source and detector, are specified
by:

* 3 surface reference vectors - origin position, surface normal at origin and reference tangent at origin
* The surface figure - planar, spherical or conic section - parameters to define the curvature etc. of the figure
* The surface boundary - circles or rectangles in local surface coordinates
* A surface quality - source of rays, detection, reflection, diffraction, scattering, refraction, absorption
* The surface deformation - a grid of displacements defined in local surface coordinates

A full list of all the currently defined elements is produced by the 
function srtlist().

Individual elements referenced by the surface element index
can be shifted and rotated using shift() and rotate().

The data base of elements can be cleared to the initial condition (no
elements defined) using the function reset(). If elements are
repeatedly defined within a procedure (for instance within a loop)
the safe and prefered option is to reset()
everything and redefine all elements each time they are required.

**Random Numbers**

The starting positions of rays, X-ray scattering angles from surface roughness and
some surface figure errors/deformations are generated using random numbers.
The sequence of random numbers used will be different each run unless the
random number seed is set using function rseed(). If the same seed value is set
before calling the function trace() exactly the same random sequence will be
generated for the ray tracing and the results will be identical.

**Coordinates**

There is no fixed coordinate system and elements can be set/defined at
any orientation. However it is conventional to use the X-axis as the
optical axis (which defines the direction of paraxial rays) and the
Y-axis as the nominal tangent reference axis. Of course given elements
may not be aligned exactly with the X-axis and Y-axis.
In most cases the local coordinates in the detector plane are nominally
aligned with the Y-axis and Z-axis. Rays are usually traced from right
to left travelling in the -X direction but this is not necessary and
it is possible for rays to bounce back and forth as in, for example,
a cassegrain system.

The source is always the first element in the sequence. All other
elements are placed in sequence as they are defined. If the source()
function is used repeatedly the source specification will be overwritten
each time.
If the detector command is used repeatedly a new detector will be
added to the sequence each time and all detectors defined will be active.

Local surface coordinates
are specified using the tangent plane
to the surface at the point defined as the surface origin. For a sphere
points on this tangent plane are projected
onto the surface along the normal to the surface at the surface
origin (Lambert's projection). The local x-axis is specified by a tangent vector
at the surface origin. The local y-axis is the cross product of the
normal and tangent vector at the surface origin.

The coordinates used for the limits of apertures and stops are given
in the docstrings of the xsrt.aperture() function.

The local coordinates used for surfaces of revolution generated from conic
sections (hyperbola, parabola, ellipse) depend on whether the surface
is designated as being "normal" or "grazing" incidence. For normal
incidence they are defined in a similar way to the planar or spherical
surfaces as given above. For grazing incidence a cylindrical coordinate
system is used where the axis is the normal to the surface at
the surface origin and the azimuth is the rotation about this axis
with zero at the surface reference axis at the surface origin. Local
coordinates are given as axial position and azimuthal position (radians).
The limits of such surfaces are specified by axial and/or radial limits
corresponding to the bottom and top edges of the surface of revolution.

**Source of Rays**

The source of rays consists of an annular or rectangular aperture on a planar
surface. The origin of each ray is a random point within
the aperture. The direction of the rays is specified either by
a source at infinity, a source at a finite distance or diffuse.
For a source at infinity all rays are parallel with the direction
set by direction cosines. A source at a finite distance is specified
by a position vector somewhere behind the aperture. Diffuse rays
are generated so as to give a uniform random distribution over a hemisphere.
The total number of rays generated is either set explicitly or by
using an aperture area per ray.

Only one source can be specified. If the source command is used in a
loop then the source will change on each pass through the loop.

The deformation index is used to specify a pixel array which spreads
out a point source into an angular distribution. The deformation data are
set using two functions xsrt.deform() and xsrt.defmat().
If the source is at infinity the x and y sample arrays must be in radians
measured from the direction **sd** along the reference axis **ar** and the
other axis.  (**an** cross **ar**).
If the source is at a finite distance then x and y are displacements
in mm (or whatever distance unit is used) of the position **sp** along
the reference axis **ar** and the other axis (**an** cross **ar**).

**Deformations**

Deformations of surfaces are specified using matricies which either span
a grid of points in the local coordinate system of the surface or
are indexed using integer labels for sectors or areas.
A set of deformations pertaining to a single surface or group of
related surfaces are given a deformation index (integer 1,2,3...).
The positions of the deformation grid points in local coordinates are
specified by two 1-dimensional arrays.

A surface deformation is applied along the normal to the surface. The
deformation value is interpolated from the 2-d grid of points.

Radial deformations for annula apertures are specified by a vector, sampling
in 1-d in azimuth, and the deformation is applied as a perturbation in the radial
direction.

The function xsrt.deform() is used to set up the dimensionality of a
particular deformation and must be the first call. The component matricies
are then set using calls to xsrt.defmat().

A deformation applied to the source() spreads the point source into a pixel
array. See **Source of Rays**.

**Detector**

The detector consists of an annular or rectangular aperture on a planar
or spherical surface. More than one detector can be specified for an instrument.
Each detector defined will
occupy a given position within the sequence of optical elements specified.

**Surface Quality, Reflectivity and Scattering**

Several surface qualities can be set up for the simulation of a given
instrument. Each is referenced using a surface quality index
(integer 1,2,3...). The type of surface can be reflecting (with reflectivity
specified using Fresnel's equations or a lookup table), refracting
or diffracting. The roughness of the surface can also be specified
using a power law distribution.

The X-ray optical constants **alpha** and **gamma** can be calculated for
a material of specified composition using the function xscat.xopt().
Within the ray tracing the reflectivity is calculated using these
constants using the same code as in function xscat.xfresnel().

The reflectivity as a function of incidence angle in other energy bands can be
calculated from the real and imaginary part of the refractive index using
the function fresnel().

Stops which are intended to block radiation have a surface quality index
set to 0. When rays hit such surfaces they are terminated (absorbed).
Detectors have surface quality index -1. If a ray hits such a surface
it is terminated (detected).
The source aperture surface has quality index -2.
The quality indices of the source, stops and detectors are set automatically.
As ray tracing proceeds rays are stored for further analysis. Each position
along a ray where an intersection with a surface element occured is
labelled with the quality index of the surface.

For a grating the surface type is it=4.
In this case the ruling direction is specified by
the surface element axis and dhub controls the geometry. dhub < 1 in-plane
in which the dhub specifies the d-spacing gradient across the ruling
and dhub > 1 off-plane where the d-spacing gradient along the ruling is
determined from the distance to the hub.

**Apertures, stops, baffles and support structure**

The function aperture() sets up stops with various geometries, single
annulus, nested annuli, rectangular holes/blocks, rectangular grid,
polar sectors, paralleogram. Cylindrical baffles in front of behind
circular apertures are set up using the function baffle(). Spider
support structures commomly used in Wolter systems are set up using
the function spider().

**Wolter Telescopes**

A nest of Wolter I shells is set up using the function w1nest() and
a conical approximation to the same by c1nest(). A Wolter II telescope
is set up using the function wolter2().
A Wolter I telescope manufactured as an array of Silicon Pore Optics
(like Athena) is set up using the function spoarr().

**Lobster Eye and Kirkpatrick-Baez Telescopes**

A lobster eye telscope is set up using the function sqmpoarr().

A silicon pore Kirkpatrick-Baez stack is defined using the function
kbs().

**Lens and Prism**

Refracting lens and prism are defined using functions lens() and prism().

**Ray Tracing and Saving Rays**

Once the source, detector and other elements have been defined rays can be
traced through the instrument using the function trace(). The form of the
output is controlled by the parameter **iopt**.

* -2 save traced.dat and detected.dat files
* -1 save detected.dat
* 0 don't save files or adjust focus
* 1 adjust focus and save detected.dat
* 2 adjust focus and save detected.dat and traced.dat
* Only rays with **iopt** reflections are used in adjustment

When **iopt** is +ve then the detector position which gives the best focus is
determined. Only rays which have **iopt** reflections and impact the detector
within a radius **riris** of the centre of the detector are included in the
analysis. The detector is shifted along the normal direction to find
the axial position of minimum rms radial spread. The results of this
analysis area returned as:

* **area**    detected area within RIRIS
* **dshft**   axial shift to optimum focus (0.0 if IOPT<=0)
* **ybar**    y centroid of detected distribution
* **zbar**    z centroid of detected distribution
* **rms**     rms radius of detected distribution

The files traced.dat and detected.dat are ASCII tabulations. 

The file traced.dat contains the paths of all the rays. It can be very large
so should not be saved unless required for detailed analysis.

* **RXP,RYP,RZP**  positions of points along each ray
* **AREA** aperture area associated with ray
* **IQU**  quality index -2 at source, 1 reflected, 0 absorbed, -1 detected

Note: in the tabulation the beginning of each ray is identified using **IQU=-2**
and the end using **IQU=0** absorbed or **IQU=-1** detected. Using these data
you can plot the paths of all the rays.

The file detected.dat contains information about the detected rays.

* **XD,YD,ZD**  the detected position for each ray
* **XC,YC,ZC**  the direction cosines for each ray
* **XR,YR,ZR**  the position of the last interaction before detection
* **YDET,ZDET** the local detected position on detector
* **AREA**  the aperture area associated with the ray
* **IREF** the number of reflections suffered by the ray

The position **XR,YR,ZR** is used to indicate where the ray came from.

The following snippets of code show how an image of the detected rays can be
generated in Python or R.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import images
    import xsrt
    ...
    ...
    # half width of image mm
    hwid=5.0
    # trace all the rays
    results=xsrt.trace(0,rdet,-2)
    # Create an image of the detected area
    XD,YD,ZD,XC,YC,ZC,XR,YR,ZR,YDET,ZDET,AREA,IREF=np.loadtxt("detected.dat",
        skiprows=1,unpack=True)
    arr=images.binxy(YDET,ZDET,0,AREA,-hwid,hwid,-hwid,hwid,nx,ny) 

.. code-block:: R

    # half width of image mm
    hwid<- 5.0
    # trace all the rays
    results<- qrt_trace(0,rdet,-2)
    # Create an image of the detected area
    detpos<-read.table("detected.dat",header=TRUE)
    aim<-qri_binxy(detpos$YDET,detpos$ZDET,0,detpos$AREA,-hwid,hwid,nx,-hwid,hwid,ny)

In Python **arr** is an image array. In R **aim** is an image object which
contains the image array **aim$data_array**.
In both cases the function images.binxy() is used to bin up the aperture area
associated with each ray into an image (2-d histogram). The effective area
is found by summing up areas of the image.
