Adding New Functions
********************

The top-level subroutines are written in Fortran 77.

The ray tracing routines are divided into 2 groups:

* Routines prefixed by QRT\_ that provide the interface to Python, R or IDL
* Routines prefixed by SRT\_ that do the ray tracing and analysis.

More general routines are prefixed with:

* QRI\_ image processing
* QR\_ general applications
* QR\_FITS for the FITS file interface

Internal Fortran routines
also have prefixes:

* AX\_ coordinate transformations
* XX\_ X-ray physics
* SYS\_ system utilities
  
Two general Fortran routines are also suppied, SCAN and LEN\_TRIM.
