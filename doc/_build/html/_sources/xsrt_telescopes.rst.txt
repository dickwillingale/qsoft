X-ray Telescopes, Lens and Prism
********************************

**Wolter Telescopes**

A nest of Wolter I shells is set up using the function w1nest() and
a conical approximation to the same by c1nest(). A Wolter II telescope
is set up using the function wolter2().
A Wolter I telescope manufactured as an array of Silicon Pore Optics
(like Athena) is set up using the function spoarr().

**Lobster Eye and Kirkpatrick-Baez Telescopes**

A lobster eye telscope is set up using the function sqmpoarr().

A silicon pore Kirkpatrick-Baez stack is defined using the function
kbs().

A Schmidt configuration lobster eye telescope is set up using the
function sle().

**Apertures, stops, baffles and support structure**

The function aperture() sets up stops with various geometries, single
annulus, nested annuli, rectangular holes/blocks, rectangular grid,
polar sectors, paralleogram. Cylindrical baffles in front of behind
circular apertures are set up using the function baffle(). Spider
support structures commomly used in Wolter systems are set up using
the function spider().

**Lens and Prism**

Refracting lens and prism are defined using functions lens() and prism().
